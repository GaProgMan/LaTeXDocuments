LaTeXDocuments
==============

A collection of my documents prepared in LaTeX.

All files within this repository are covered by a GPL v2 licence (details can be found in the "LICENCE" file). Sharing, re-use and editing is actively encouraged though you must give attribution to the authors of any files used (a mention in the comments is enough).

## Compilation

These files were all built using TeXWorks (version 0.4.5) or TexMaker (version 4.2) for Microsoft Windows using the built in libraries of a FULL install. No custom libraries or fonts were used in developing these files (unless stated otherwise in the comments/readme for each file).
